<p>To help your community have awesome talks from a diverse set of speakers, jump into your community's repository and give some feedback.</p>

<p>No matter how you contribute, remember: be respectful and kind. :)</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>When speakers ask for help choosing a topic, give honest, constructive feedback about which suggested topics you like. Give reasons!</li>
<li>If you have experience submitting responses to a call for proposals, help others who are seeking help doing the same.</li>
<li>When speakers are looking for help finishing a talk, share your knowledge or identify questions you've always had about the topic they're speaking about.</li>
<li>When speakers are looking for feedback on a finished talk, watch it. Think about whether the core message is clear, and whether the talk is focused or needs to be tightened up.</li>
</ul>
